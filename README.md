# kitten-launcher

`kitten-launcher`'s purpose is to make
[kitten](github.com/KissKissBankBank/kitten) build and integration easier on
client applications.

It should eventually propose a set of scripts to compile
[kitten](github.com/KissKissBankBank/kitten) with
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).
